## About
This program generates a header image for my blog at [https://dylans.blog](http://dylans.blog).


## How to use it
Either run it directly with `go run main.go` or `go build` it and run the binary.

In either case use `--help` to get a full list of supported options.

The code is mostly adapted from [this blogpost](https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/dynamically-generate-social-images-in-golang-by-mat-ryer.html) with some added CLI options to make it easier to use. They do some more stuff like adding additional text and making a gif out of it if you're interested.

## Contribute
I'm not likely to actually take contributions on this, the code is fairly simple and serves a single purpose. If you want to build upon it just fork it and go nuts.
