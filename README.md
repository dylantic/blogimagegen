## About
This program generates a header image for my blog at [https://dylans.blog](http://dylans.blog).

## How to use it
Either run it directly with `go run main.go` or `go build` it and run the binary.

In either case use `--help` to get a full list of supported options.

Realistically you can use different typefaces with the program, but I've found that some typefaces do not survive Go's image generation very well. Open Sans seems to cope without issue, but Montserrat for example had holes in the glyphs or overlapping lines. 

## Example
![An example header](https://github.com/dylantic/blogimagegen/blob/main/header.jpeg?raw=true)  
This image was generated with the following command:
```
go run main.go --title "This is an example image generated by this program." --font fonts/OpenSans_SemiCondensed-Bold.ttf --output header.jpeg --fontsize 40 --format jpeg --quality 80 --width 750 --height 300
```

I recommend you play with the fontsize a bit depending on the text you're placing on the image. I think it's aesthetically pleasing when text fills out a good portion of the image and does not wrap on awkward spots.

The code is mostly adapted from [this blogpost](https://pace.dev/blog/2020/03/02/dynamically-generate-social-images-in-golang-by-mat-ryer.html) with some added CLI options to make it easier to use. They do some more stuff like adding additional text and making a gif out of it if you're interested.

## Contribute
I'm not likely to actually take contributions on this, the code is fairly simple and serves a single purpose. If you want to build upon it just fork it and go nuts.
